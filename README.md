Hi! This is me learning how to use Github. I am a computer science student (via correspondence) and have a year to go before completing my BSc degree. I reckon it's a brilliant idea to know what Github is, and how to use it. That is why I created this account a short while back. I have not had much time to do much with it, but here I am finally going through it.
I am an IT techie (independent contractor), and have studied C, C++, Java and Delphi through my University and taught myself Android this year. I love developing software! From database systems to games to multiple choice applications, I have done it all. Unfortunately 90% of it was for myself and so it won't count much in my CV/resume. Guess I will have to start from the bottom like everybody else.

Phew!

Did I mention that I love programming? Just like Kel loves orange soda, I do-I do-I do-I doooo!
